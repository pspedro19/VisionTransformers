## Migration Guides

### Migrating from v1.x to v2.0

**Breaking Changes:**
1. **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.9+ (was 3.7+)
2. **Dependencies**: Now requires PyTorch 2.0+, transformers, decord
3. **API Changes**: Complete API redesign
4. **Configuration**: Moved from JSON to YAML format

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Update Python and dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Old installation
   pip install vitgif-highlight==1.2.1
   
   # New installation
   pip install vitgif-highlight[all]==2.0.0
   ```

2. **Update CLI usage:**
   ```bash
   # Old CLI
   vitgif input.mp4 output.gif --fps 5
   
   # New CLI
   vitgif process input.mp4 output.gif --fps 5
   ```

3. **Update Python API:**
   ```python
   # Old API
   from vitgif import VideoProcessor
   processor = VideoProcessor()
   processor.create_gif("input.mp4", "output.gif", fps=5)
   
   # New API
   import src as vitgif
   result = vitgif.process_video("input.mp4", "output.gif", fps=5)
   ```

4. **Update configuration:**
   ```yaml
   # New config format (config.yaml)
   model:
     name: "videomae-base"
     device: "cuda"
   gif:
     fps: 5
     overlay_style: "heatmap"
   ```
